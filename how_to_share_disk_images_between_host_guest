This is a method to describe how to share files between vm host and guest.

1. create a raw image file on the KVM manager

2. on the host, use the fdisk to format the raw image as disk

3. mount the image to the loop

$ file vm-disk1-image-20g.img
vm-disk1-image-20g.img: DOS/MBR boot sector; partition 1 : ID=0x86, start-CHS (0x0,32,33), end-CHS (0x232,212,34), startsector 2048, 41940992 sectors

Note:  notice the starting sector.

$ fdisk -l vm-disk1-image-20g.img
Disk vm-disk1-image-20g.img: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x9335bf47

Device                  Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type
vm-disk1-image-20g.img1       2048 41943039 41940992  20G 86 NTFS volume set

Note: The offset = 2048x512 = 1,048,576

4. use the losetup command to mount up the raw disk image

   losetup --offset 1048576 /dev/loopxx vm-disk-image

5. format the disk image

   mkfs.nfts -f /dev/loopxxx

6. now mount the image as disk

   mount /dev/loopxx /mnt/usb

7. now, add the image file as a disk to the guest

8. open the gust vm and mount the new disk as normal.

9. the content are been shared as soon as you remount the same disk image on the host.
note: mount the image on the host as read only

  mount -o ro /dev/loopxx /mnt/usb

10. to unmount the disk
  umount /mnt/ust
  
11. clean up the loop devices
  losetup -d /dev/loopxx
  
  to check if the look device is clean
  losetup -a
  
  you shouldn't see the mount loop image.
